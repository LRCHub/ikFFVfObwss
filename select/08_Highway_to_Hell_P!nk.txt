Living easy
Loving free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Taking everything but my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I would rather do
Going down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too, eh

I'm on a highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Im'on the highway to hell

No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me 'round
Hey Satan
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey momma
Look at me
I'm on my way to the Promised Land, woh

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Mmm, don't stop me
No, oh, ouw

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to
Hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

And I'm goin' down, all the waa-ay-aay, wohh
M-on the highway to hell
