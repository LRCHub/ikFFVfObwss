Flying in the sky
Pedal to the metal on the highway to Hell
Lord, save me
Mountains on fire out in California
You been ridin' through my mind like a motorcycle
Sacrifice a lot just to get this new watch
Pedal to the metal
I talked to God the other day and said, "I'll never settle"

You real or you not
You want what I got
I know that it's true
I used to be you
Would do what you do
But don't come 'round me
I'm on the highway to Hell
Lord, save me
I'm on the highway to Hell
Lord, save me

Simon says that we in here
Mama said it takes some time
Takes some time
I know it takes some time
First ten
At first, you get a look
Over then, you turn into the man
In the ten
Every five years, man, you gotta reinvent

Flying in the sky
Pedal to the metal on the highway to Hell
Lord, save me
Mountains on fire out in California
You been ridin' through my mind like a motorcycle
Sacrifice a lot just to get this new watch
Pedal to the metal
I talked to God the other day and said, "I'll never settle"
